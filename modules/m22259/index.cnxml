The importance of sticking to the rules of the game must be brought to bear on them in every activity in which they participate. The way in which the educator handles the rules and discipline in relation to the learning content will determine the degree of success attained in this module. The games are conducive to the development of team spirit and esprit de corps in this grade. Practising the relay races, hurdles, long jump and HOP, SKIP AND JUMP also offers the learners the opportunity to prepare for the schoolâ€™s sports day.</para>
