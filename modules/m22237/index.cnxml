        <para id="id1165331908915">It would be ideal if the class group could start an environmental project in the area through which they could make a positive contribution. You could all go on a cleaning-up excursion in and around the local river on a Saturday. Make sure that safety precautions are taken, e.g. gloves must be worn and no one should go into the river without shoes. Ask your parents to be involved in the project.</para>

They are also made increasingly aware of health risks in their own environment and of their responsibilities regarding the maintenance of balanced ecosystems. While there was merely a brief reference to certain childrenâ€™s rights in Grade 4, the Grade 5 learners are now given the opportunity to focus on their rights and duties as citizens of the country. The sensitive issue of child abuse is also broached. Educators must realise that they have a great responsibility as consultants, confidants and counsellors in this regard. It is here that serious problems can be identified and prevented. It is essential that educators should know the correct procedure should they have to deal with a case of child abuse. During discussions on contagious diseases educators are also in a position to play an important role in preventing life-threatening diseases such as TB, cholera and aids by approaching these topics with the necessary seriousness.</para>
